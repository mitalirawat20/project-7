Advancing Heart Disease Diagnosis through Artificial Neural Networks: A Step Towards Precision Healthcare

Early detection is essential for efficient management and prevention of heart disease, which continues to rank among the world’s top causes of mortality. The use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to forecast the risk of heart disease based on a variety of medical characteristics is investigated in this work. We develop and test a feedforward neural network predictive model using a dataset comprising variables like age, blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol, and so on. Preprocessed data is used to train the model, which includes methods for managing missing values, one-hot encoding, and normalisation. Following training, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the model’s performance. According to the findings, ANN can effectively categorise patients who are at risk for heart disease, providing a useful tool for early diagnosis. This study shows how machine learning, in particular artificial neural networks (ANNs), can be used in medical diagnostics to increase the speed and precision of heart disease identification. Hyperparameter adjustment and the use of more sophisticated deep learning architectures can be investigated in future research.
